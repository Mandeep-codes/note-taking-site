# 📝 Note Taking Site

A lightweight and minimal web app for creating and managing notes, built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks. Users can write, delete, and view notes directly in the browser. Notes are stored locally, making it a fast and offline-friendly tool.

🛠️ I made this while learning how to use vanilla JavaScript to build dynamic front-end apps without relying on any libraries or frameworks. It helped me understand DOM manipulation, event handling, and working with browser storage.
